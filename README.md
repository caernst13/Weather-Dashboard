# Weather-Dashboard

This project was about working with APIs to access real worl real time data and build a weather forecaster around it. Along with being the first project to work with APIs this project also had an emphasis on bootstrap and again local storage. 

In this project I learned about APIs and reading documentation. All APIs are different and being able to work with them requires being able to understand docs. I also got a better understanding of both local storage and bootstrap and feel much more confident with both of them.
